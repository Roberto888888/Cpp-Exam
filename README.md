# Cpp-Exam

This is the exam for a course I took during my master degree about programming in C++.

I had 4 hours to solve it.

It's not really that complicated but several of the tools used in it weren't covered in the course so we were required to be able to retrieve what we needed (we were allowed to use online documentation).
