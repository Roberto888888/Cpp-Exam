## Fun with a tree structure.

## NOTE: the name of the folder is wrong but it contains the correct files.

## NOTE: For the exam we were provided with the declarations of the functions we had to use. For this exam we were asked with a data container that personally I don't think it's the best choice for this task so I have included a different version too.
